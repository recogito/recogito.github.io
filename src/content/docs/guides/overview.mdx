## Architecture Overview

Recogito Studio consists primarily of two integrated components:

- **[recogito-client](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-client)** (Astro.js + Vite) - Client web application
- **[recogito-server](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-server)** (Supabase + PostgreSQL) - Database backend and file storage

It also offers extended functionality through plugins, and an SDK for developing plugins.
