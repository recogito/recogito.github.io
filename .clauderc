# Local Development Documentation Process

## Objectives
- Primary goal: Create accurate documentation for developers
- The local dev environment setup is a means to validate and improve documentation

## Issue Tracking Approach
1. **Capture issues and solutions** as we encounter them during setup
2. **Log in separate file**: Create `local-dev-setup-log.md` for trial-and-error tracking
3. **Clean documentation**: Update the public-facing guide to be polished, not a troubleshooting log
4. **Reference existing docs**: When solutions exist in reference pages, update those and link from the guide

## Documentation Structure
- Issues/solutions log: `~/repos/recogito.github.io/local-dev-setup-log.md` (not published)
- Public guide: `~/repos/recogito.github.io/src/content/docs/guides/local-development.mdx`
- Reference docs: `~/repos/recogito.github.io/src/content/docs/reference/*.md`

## Process for Each Step
1. Attempt the step as documented
2. If issues arise, document them in the log file
3. Find/implement solutions
4. Update appropriate documentation (guide or reference pages)
5. Add cross-references between documents
