      <description>Customizing Visual Appearance Need a different look and feel? Customizing the visual appearance of Annotorious is easy! All elements of the annotation layer and the editor window can be styled with CSS.
Customizing the Annotation Layer Annotorious renders annotations using SVG, which means you can completely alter the visual appearance of every graphical element via CSS.

      <description>Contributing UI Translations We want to make our user interface available in as many languages as possible. If you want to help: providing a translation is easy - and because there are not many labeled elements, it&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of work.
Message Dictionaries The user interface labels are part of recogito-client-core, a JavaScript package for common code shared between Annotorious and RecogitoJS. In this folder you will find messages files, one file for each available translation.</description>

      <description>Hacker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Annotorious and RecogitoJS We welcome pull requests to Annotorious and RecogitoJS - both to the code, as well as to our documentation! To contribute, simply fork the relevant repository and hack away. Our code is located in the following repositories
 recogito/recogito-client-core. A base module that contains most of the code for RecogitoJS, and all code that is shared between RecogitoJS and Annotorious. You&amp;rsquo;ll need this module if you want to hack anything about RecogitoJS (text selection, relationship drawing) or the common editor popup.</description>
