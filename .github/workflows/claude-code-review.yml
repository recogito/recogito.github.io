            Focus ONLY on significant issues:
            - Bugs or correctness problems
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance issues
            - Architectural concerns

            Skip minor style/formatting unless critical. Be matter-of-fact and concise.
            Keep comments brief and actionable. For small changes, a simple "LGTM" or 1-2 sentence summary is sufficient.
